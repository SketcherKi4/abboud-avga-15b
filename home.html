        Here at POWERWASHMANIA, we strive to create the best<br />, customer
        expierence. You don't like how a job was done?<br />
        We will come out and fix it, no questions asked. We<br />do this because
        we are a Christian based company, and we <br />feel as if our job is not
        done, unless we are giving it<br />our 100%. We care for our customers,
        and believe any human <br />
        deserves the right to be treated fairly. Even at <br />
        a level as little as a powerwash job. We offer our<br />
        jobs at a flat rate of $20 + $15 per hour, and do not<br />
        worry, we are not procrastinators. If we take over an<br />
        hour and a half per indivisual clean, then you get<br />
        the service FOR FREE! This will come with a <br />
        negotiation before depending on the job size. We<br />
        hope that you get the best experience, THANKYOU!

          <h4>Holiday Season</h4>
          We are donating 15% of our earnings to kids in need. Some people
          cannot celebrate like we can, so we want to make their season. We will
          use the money to buy them gifts.
